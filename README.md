The mobileapp repository provides a starting point for creating a customizable mobile application that leverages
the Ndex Systems (www.ndexsystems.com) data utility services.  Ndex captures financial data from any 
source – custodian direct feeds, web-portals, PDF statements, custom Excel templates – into one unified application.

Ndex provides access to data fed directly from over 270 custodians and over 7500 website through a single portal. 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application and provides information on connecting
to data exported from Ndex Systems and uploaded to an SQLITE Database.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
